# Chromebrew ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} variable adjustments

# Do not edit this file. It will be overwritten by updates.

# Don't use `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${CREW_LIB_PREFIX}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}`, as it may
# result in multiple copies of the same lines in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
# Instead, only add ${CREW_LIB_PREFIX} to ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} if it isn't there already.
#
# Disabled to see if we can get away without setting this, since we want our
# LD_PRELOAD binary for a given binary's architecture to load depending upon
# the architecture specific library path under our CREW_PREFIX.
#[[ "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" == *"$CREW_LIB_PREFIX"* ]] || LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${CREW_LIB_PREFIX}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
